Hi everyone! It’s been a little while since the last update, but I’ve been working on a very important feature for **_Duskvale_**.

## Database Redesign

The previous database model was missing a lot of required tables for planned features and wasn’t built with scalability in mind.

The new database design is much more scalable and will allow me to dynamically update the game as development continues.

## Admin Panel

With the new database in place, I needed a tool to manage and modify game data more easily — so I built an internal admin panel.

This panel will allow me to quickly create and edit items, enemies, and other game content without diving into the raw database every time. It’s a behind-the-scenes tool, but it’s going to massively speed up development going forward.

## Inventory Prototype

Because there were no updates for a bit of time, here’s a little sneak peek of the first inventory prototype!

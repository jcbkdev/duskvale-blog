Hi! I'm **JCBK**, currently the sole developer working on **Duskvale** - my passion project I've been dreaming about for a long time.

Duskvale is planned to be a browser-based MMORPG game with an interactive **2.5D style combat**, but point-and-click exploration on an overworld map. The game is **designed with busy players in mind** ‚Äî those who may only have time during breaks ‚Äî by combining turn-based, engaging combat with more relaxed, semi-passive exploration to create a balanced mix of active and idle gameplay.

Over the past few months I‚Äôve been working on the core systems of Duskvale, such as:

- Combat System
- Character Creation
- Leveling System
- Abilities
- Authentication
- Database

...and more, but there is still a lot to do, so I encourage you to follow the journey as **Duskvale** aims to bring a fresh take on the classic browser MMO genre.

## What's Done So Far

### Combat System

Turn-based system that calculates action priority based on player's current energy and attack speed. Stat-based modifiers, defensive stances, buffs, debuffs, posions and much more...

### Character Classes

Classes can evolve into subclasses, allowing players to have a more flexible playstyle. Each subclass has unique abilities and requirements. _More info in the future..._ ü§´

### Leveling

World map will be divided into different biomes and zones, each biome has its own unique monsters and zones determine the enemies level. Some zones will have a bit of level scaling, but with a cap ‚Äî so you won‚Äôt suddenly run into a level 100 monster in the starting area. I want the world to feel dynamic but still have a natural sense of progression.

## What's Next

### Playable Prototype

Right now I'm not able to test the mechanics and _feel_ the gameplay, so building a playable prototype is my main focus.

### World Builder

A tool to help speed up world creation‚Äîplacing tiles, adding events, and shaping the map more efficiently.

### Taverns & Quests

Each biome will have a few taverns, and in each one, you‚Äôll be able to pick up some quests to help you explore and progress through the zone.

This is just the beginning. Duskvale is a huge project, and I‚Äôll be documenting my progress here step by step. Thanks for reading ‚Äî and if you‚Äôre interested in helping test the game, stay tuned!
